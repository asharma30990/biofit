          <h2>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h2>
          <p>
            The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe
            that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under the U.S. copyright law. If you believe
            in good faith that materials hosted by COMPANY infringe your copyright, you, or your agent may send to
            COMPANY a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it be blocked. Any notification by a
            copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the
            DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon COMPANY actual
            knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident. If you believe in
            good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you
            to send to COMPANY a counter-notice. All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory
            requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. COMPANY's Copyright Agent
            for notice shall be support@goBiofit.com

          <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms of Use shall be governed by and varrued in accordance with the laws of the State of Barbados and
            any dispute shall be subject to binding arbitration in St. Michael, Barbados. If any provision of this
            agreement shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed
            severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
            provisions.

          <h2>Class Action Waiver</h2>
          <p>
            You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a
            class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private
            attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
            form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or
            private attorney general action) unless all relevant parties specifically agree to do so following
            initiation of the arbitration.
          </p>
          <h2>Severability</h2>
          <p>
            If any clause within these Terms of Service (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be
            illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from these Terms of Service, and the remainder of
            these Terms of Service will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be
            illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a
            court.
